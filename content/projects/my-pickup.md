Zero Stress Commute
MyPickup is a Weekly & Monthly Subscription based electric rides for daily commute.
I was part of the team that developed the mobile application for the service. The app was developed using Flutter and Dart. The app uses Google Maps, Google Places, Google Directions and Google Places API for location services. The app also uses Firebase for backend services. The app was developed using Getx for state management.
